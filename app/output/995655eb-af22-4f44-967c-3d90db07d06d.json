    "question": "How does seven regional labs in CDC\u2019s AR Lab Network work?",
    "answer": "\nThe seven regional labs in CDC's AR Lab Network collaborate and support each other during emergencies, such as the pandemic, to maintain critical national testing for antimicrobial resistance. They may offer tests outside of their typical regions to support other labs that are facing challenges, such as supply shortages or staff diversion for COVID-19 testing. Additionally, the AR Lab Network may use its sequencing capacity to study emerging threats, such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These collaborations demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability of the AR Lab Network and CDC's investments in antimicrobial resistance."
