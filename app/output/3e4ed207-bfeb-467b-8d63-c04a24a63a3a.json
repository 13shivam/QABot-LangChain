    "question": "What is a Compiler Architecture?",
    "answer": "\nCompiler architecture refers to the basic components and processes involved in the compilation of a program. This includes the front end, which checks the syntax and structure of the program, the optimizer, which improves the efficiency of the code, and the back end, which generates the machine code that can be executed by the computer. Additionally, compiler architecture may also include various techniques and algorithms used to optimize and improve the generated code."
