    "question": "What is a Conditional Branch?",
    "answer": " A conditional branch is an instruction in a computer program that directs the flow of control to a different section of code based on certain conditions being met. It is typically used in high-level languages to create two-way or multiple-alternative conditionals, allowing for more complex decision-making in the program. The specific conditions that must be met for the branch to occur are determined by the programmer and can be based on various factors such as variable values or flag values."
